## Testing Results

### WPS API Filter Testing
âœ… **Product Type Filtering**: Successfully filters by "Suspension" products
âœ… **Brand Filtering**: Successfully filters by specific brand IDs (e.g., brand_id=406)
âœ… **Price Range Filtering**: Successfully filters by price ranges (e.g., $100-$150)
âœ… **Stock Status Filtering**: Successfully filters by stock status (STK)
âœ… **Drop Ship Filtering**: Successfully filters by drop ship eligibility
âœ… **MAP Policy Filtering**: Successfully filters by MAP policy items
âœ… **Combined Filters**: Multiple filters work together correctly

### Sample API Queries Tested
```bash
# Suspension products from specific brand in price range
filter[product_type]=Suspension&filter[brand_id]=406&filter[list_price][gte]=100&filter[list_price][lte]=150

# Tools with MAP policy
filter[product_type]=Tools&filter[has_map_policy]=true

# In-stock items only
filter[status]=STK

# Drop ship eligible items
filter[drop_ship_eligible]=true
```
